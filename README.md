Between August 2015 and April 2016.

This report presents the analysis of the refrigerators characteristics data that was collected between Aug 2015 and April 2016 by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (eia). We will utilize a total of four data tables to explore the different trends between refrigerator types and refrigerator sizes across the different regions, South/West and North/Midwest, and across different income brackets and household sizes in the U.S. Based on that, we will discuss potential plans for effective marketing stratifies to increase the profit of refrigerators companies.
